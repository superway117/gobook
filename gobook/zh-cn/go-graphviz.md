Go bindings for Graphviz

Pure Go Library
- No need to install Graphviz library ( brew install graphviz or apt-get install graphviz )
- The Graphviz library has been converted to WebAssembly (WASM) and embedded it, so it works consistently across all environments
- Supports encoding/decoding for DOT language
- Supports custom renderer for custom format
- Supports setting graph properties in a type-safe manner
