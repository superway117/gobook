## Quickstart

[esbuild](https://github.com/privatenumber/esbuild-loader) is a JavaScript bundler written in Go that supports blazing fast ESNext & TypeScript transpilation and JS minification.

[esbuild-loader](https://github.com/privatenumber/esbuild-loader) lets you harness the speed of esbuild in your Webpack build by offering faster alternatives for transpilation (eg. babel-loader/ts-loader) and minification (eg. Terser)!
