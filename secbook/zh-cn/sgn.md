## Quickstart

SGN is a polymorphic binary encoder for offensive security purposes such as generating statically undetecable binary payloads. It uses a additive feedback loop to encode given binary instructions similar to LSFR. This project is the reimplementation of the original Shikata ga nai in golang with many improvements.
