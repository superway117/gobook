## QuickStart

If you don't want to deal with servers and complex configurations when performing recon but would like more features in an integrated solution, Findomain offers a subdomains monitoring service that provides directory fuzzing, port scanning, vulnerability discovery, and more. Monitor your target domains with several popular tools (including OWASP Amass, Sublist3r, Assetfinder and Subfinder) and receive alerts through Discord, Slack, Telegram, Email, or Push Notifications (Android/iOS/Smart Watch/Desktop) when new subdomains are found.

The only thing you need to do is configure a file with your email address, webhooks, or Telegram information, and include your domains in another file. You will then have a fully-automated subdomain monitoring service that will keep you up to date with any new subdomains discovered, along with Host IPs, HTTP status, website screenshots, Open Ports, CNAME records, and more. User data is securely stored in a relational database -- you can request a dump of your data at any time.

When you finish your payment, you will receive an email with the server credentials and documentation regarding configuration and other details.
